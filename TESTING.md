# Testing

## Validation commands

Run the checks relevant to a change before opening a pull request. See
[TOOLING.md](TOOLING.md) for every command and the tools behind them.

| Command | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm verify:fast` | Every change: Biome CI, typecheck, and unit tests. Runs in seconds. |
| `pnpm verify:full` | Before a pull request: `verify:static` (adds coverage thresholds, architecture, unused code, duplication, spelling, Markdown, complexity, React diagnostics) plus `verify:build` (browser tests, production build with size budgets, Ladle build). |
| `pnpm verify:e2e` | Changes that affect pages or visual output: functional, accessibility, and visual Playwright specs. |
| `pnpm verify:security` | Dependency or configuration changes: Semgrep rule tests and scan, Gitleaks, workflow lint, and `pnpm audit`. Needs the host tools in [TOOLING.md](TOOLING.md#host-prerequisites). |

`pnpm verify:fast` must stay fast. It runs only the `unit` Vitest project; browser,
end-to-end, visual, and mutation tests are deliberately outside it.

For a manual smoke test, run `pnpm dev` and verify the affected route in a
browser, including its loading, error, and localized states where applicable.

## Test layers

| Layer | Location and name | Runner | Command | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unit and hook | `src/**/*.test.ts(x)` next to the source | Vitest `unit` project, `jsdom` | `pnpm test` | Functions, utilities, hooks, and business logic. |
| Property-based | Inside unit tests, with `fast-check` | Vitest `unit` | `pnpm test` | Pure logic with a large input space, such as `isLocale`. |
| Browser component | `src/**/*.browser.test.tsx` | Vitest `browser` project, Chromium | `pnpm test:browser` | Behavior that needs a real browser: viewport and media queries, focus, real events. |
| End-to-end | `tests/*.spec.ts` | Playwright | `pnpm test:e2e` | User journeys against a production build. |
| Accessibility | `tests/a11y.spec.ts`, titled `@a11y` | Playwright and axe-core | `pnpm test:a11y` | Automated WCAG 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 A/AA scans (`wcag2a`, `wcag2aa`, `wcag21a`, `wcag21aa`, `wcag22aa`) in light and dark mode. |
| Visual regression | `tests/visual.spec.ts`, titled `@visual` | Playwright screenshots (CI only) | `pnpm test:visual` | Layout and theme changes in rendered pages. |
| Mutation | `stryker.config.json` | Stryker | `pnpm test:mutation` | On-demand check of test strength. Currently unreliable; see [TOOLING.md](TOOLING.md#known-limitations). |

Choose the lightest layer that can fail for the right reason. Keep a behavior
in `jsdom` when a stub is enough, and move it to Browser Mode only when the real
browser matters (for example, `use-mobile.browser.test.tsx` uses a real viewport
instead of a stubbed `matchMedia`).

## Test placement and scope

- Place Vitest unit tests for functions, utilities, hooks, and business logic
  next to their source module with `*.test.ts`.
- Place React component and JSX integration tests next to their source module
  with `*.test.tsx`. Use `*.browser.test.tsx` for Browser Mode tests.
- Place Playwright specifications in root `tests/` with `*.spec.ts`. Keep E2E
  fixtures and helpers there only when they are E2E-specific and shared.
- Do not create empty test directories or placeholder tests. Do not create a
  global `unit/`, `components/`, or `integration/` directory, nor a
  `__tests__/` folder for every component.
- Preserve App Router organization: colocating a test does not make a route
  public, and `_components` and `_lib` remain suitable private locations.
- Do not write a test only to make a tool report success. When a tool has no
  suitable subject yet, leave it unused and say so.

Two Vitest suites verify configuration rather than application behavior:
`src/messages/messages.test.ts` checks that every locale catalog has the same
keys and ICU arguments as the default locale and no empty messages, and
`.biome/rules/nextjs/rules.test.ts` lints fixtures to prove each Grit rule
reports invalid code and accepts valid code. Semgrep rules are tested with
`semgrep --test` (`pnpm check:security:rules`) and ast-grep rules with
`ast-grep test`.

Use Vitest with React Testing Library for synchronous units, components, and
integrations. Favor `getByRole` and other accessible queries. Test observable
behavior, not external-library internals; keep feature-specific mocks and
fixtures local until there is actual reuse. Use small snapshots only when their
output is the contract.

Use Playwright for browser journeys and asynchronous Server Components. Vitest
does not currently support async Server Components completely, so do not build
testing workarounds for them. Add MSW only when a shared network-mocking need
exists (ADR 0006).

At minimum, new tests should be deterministic, independent of external
services, and safe to run in CI. Mock network and clock dependencies where
needed. Do not store production credentials or personal data in test fixtures.

## Visual regression workflow

Baselines are Linux screenshots, generated and compared in CI inside the pinned
Playwright container, so they never depend on your machine. Locally, the
`@visual` specs are skipped (set `PLAYWRIGHT_VISUAL=1` to run them anyway).

1. Open a pull request or push. The **End-to-end, accessibility and visual** job
   compares screenshots and uploads the `playwright-report` artifact; open it to
   see the expected, actual, and diff images.
2. If the change is not intentional, fix the code.
3. If it is intentional, run the **Update visual baselines** workflow (Actions
   tab, or `gh workflow run visual-baselines.yml --ref <branch>`), then download
   and review the images and commit them:

   ```bash
   gh run download <run-id> --name visual-baselines      --dir tests/visual.spec.ts-snapshots
   ```

Differences up to 1% of pixels are tolerated (`maxDiffPixelRatio` in
`playwright.config.ts`). Never update baselines just to silence a failure.

## Component workbench

Write a colocated `*.stories.tsx` next to a component to review it in isolation:

```bash
pnpm ladle         # serve the workbench
pnpm ladle:build   # production build in reports/ladle
```

`.ladle/components.tsx` wraps every story in the same providers as
`src/app/layout.tsx` (theme, intl, tooltip) and loads `src/app/globals.css`.
Cover the variants and states a reviewer needs to see, not every prop.

## Coverage, complexity, and size

- `pnpm test:coverage` writes `coverage/`. It measures application code and
  leaves out the vendored `src/components/ui/*.tsx` and
  `src/components/ai-elements`; `src/components/ui/extensions` is measured.
- `vitest.config.mts` sets a coverage floor of 70% (statements, branches,
  functions, lines), just below the template's current 74%. Raise it as
  application code grows; never lower it to pass a run. `json-summary` feeds
  the CI step summary.
- `pnpm analyze:health` runs coverage and feeds it to Fallow so CRAP scores
  reflect real tests; `pnpm analyze:fallow` reuses an existing `coverage/`. Add a test before accepting a complex, untested function.
- `pnpm analyze:size` builds the app and fails when generated client JavaScript or
  CSS exceeds the gzip budgets in `.size-limit.json`. Raise a budget only with a
  reason in the pull request.

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on pull requests, pushes to `main`, and manual
`workflow_dispatch`. Jobs run in parallel:

| Job | Runs | Local equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `static` | Biome, typecheck, unit tests with coverage thresholds, architecture, Knip, jscpd, ast-grep, CSpell, markdownlint, Fallow, React Doctor | `pnpm verify:static` |
| `build` | Vitest Browser Mode, production build with size budgets, Ladle production build | `pnpm verify:build` |
| `e2e` | Playwright functional, accessibility, and visual specs in the pinned Playwright container | `pnpm verify:e2e` |
| `security` | Semgrep rule tests and scan (`--error`), Gitleaks, actionlint, zizmor, `pnpm audit`, pre-commit | `pnpm verify:security` |
| `pr-title` | Conventional Commit PR title (pull requests only) | `echo "feat: title" \| pnpm exec commitlint` |
| `ci-result` | Aggregates the jobs above; use it as the single required status check | n/a |

Pull-request runs cancel superseded runs (including when the title is edited,
which re-runs the title check); pushes to `main` each get their own
concurrency group and are never cancelled. The
coverage report and the Playwright report and `test-results` are uploaded as
artifacts for seven days, and coverage plus the job results are summarized on
the run page. Run `pnpm check:workflows` after editing a workflow, and keep
actions and the Playwright container pinned by commit SHA or digest.

Dependabot opens weekly grouped updates for npm and GitHub Actions
(`.github/dependabot.yml`); review each one, there is no auto-merge. It does not
cover the Playwright container tag and digest in the workflows, so bump them
together with `@playwright/test` and regenerate baselines with the
`Update visual baselines` workflow.

### Adapting the tests in a generated project

Reusable infrastructure: the Vitest and Playwright configs, the axe scan, the
locale-cookie and external-link behaviors, and the visual-baseline workflow.
Tied to the starter UI: `tests/home.spec.ts` (title, "To get started, edit"
headings, "Deploy Now" and "Documentation" links) and the `home-*` visual
baselines. Replace these with your own pages, then regenerate baselines with the
`Update visual baselines` workflow.

### Automated accessibility limits

axe-core detects only a subset of WCAG failures. It does not verify keyboard
operation, focus order, screen-reader output, or content quality, so passing
scans do not mean WCAG compliance. Test those manually.

### Scheduled and manual checks

`.github/workflows/scheduled-quality.yml` runs weekly (Mondays 06:00 UTC) and on
manual dispatch, outside the pull-request path:

- `mutation`: Stryker (`pnpm test:mutation`); fails below the `break` score in
  `stryker.config.json` and uploads the HTML report.
- `lighthouse`: builds and serves the app, then runs
  `pnpm analyze:lighthouse:ci` and uploads the report. It is report-only: it
  fails only when the audit cannot run, because no score threshold is set.

Fallow and React Doctor already run in the `static` job. The Lighthouse job's
runner setup (Playwright Chromium with `--no-sandbox`) was verified locally but
not yet on a hosted runner; check the first scheduled run.

### Known limitations

- The `braces` advisory exception in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` is documented there;
  revisit it when the advisory is withdrawn or the dependency chain drops it.
- `pnpm check:security` must run inside a Git work tree; Semgrep stalls on
  Windows when the directory is not a repository.
- Dependabot cannot read workflow `container:` images or tool pins, so
  `.github/dependabot-mirror/` holds a Dockerfile and a `requirements.txt` that
  receive those bumps. Copy a Playwright image bump into `ci.yml` and
  `visual-baselines.yml` by hand. Gitleaks and actionlint versions stay manual.
- Deployment is intentionally absent; add provider-specific CD in the derived
  project.
- On Windows, set `PYTHONUTF8=1` when running Semgrep locally, or it can exit
  with code 2 on an output encoding error.

## First-time setup

Install the browser binaries once per environment:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
```

Playwright starts the application itself (`pnpm build && pnpm start`), reusing a
server on port 3000 when one is already running outside CI.

## Pull request evidence

In the pull request description, state the commands run and the relevant
manual checks. Call out deliberately untested behavior, the reason it could
not be exercised, and any known baseline validation failure.
