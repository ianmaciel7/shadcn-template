# Tooling

## Tool inventory

This is the operational inventory of tools installed or configured by this
repository. It is not a catalog of every runtime library; `package.json` and
`pnpm-lock.yaml` remain the source of truth for those dependencies.

| Category | Tool | Version or status | Purpose | Source of truth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Package management | pnpm | 12.11.2 | Installs dependencies and runs project commands. Do not use npm or Yarn to modify dependencies. | `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` |
| Application build | Next.js | 16.4.1 | App Router framework, development server, production build, and server runtime. | `package.json`, `next.config.ts` |
| Bundler | Turbopack | Included with Next.js | Bundles development and production builds; loads Tailwind CSS through `@tailwindcss/turbopack`. | `next.config.ts` |
| Language | TypeScript | `^5` (5.9.3 locked) | Provides type checking and the `@/*` import alias. | `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` |
| Compiler | React Compiler | 1.0.0 | Optimizes React components through Next.js configuration. | `package.json`, `next.config.ts` |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | `^4` | Generates utility CSS and is loaded by Turbopack (and by Vite for Ladle). | `package.json`, `next.config.ts`, `.ladle/vite.config.mjs`, `src/app/globals.css` |
| Code quality | Biome | 2.5.15 | Formats code, runs lint checks, and organizes imports. | `package.json`, `biome.json` |
| Custom code quality rules | GritQL | Executed by Biome; no standalone CLI | Supplies the three project-specific Next.js rules for layout props, page props, and route context. Regression-tested in `.biome/rules/nextjs/rules.test.ts`. | `.biome/rules/nextjs/*.grit`, `biome.json` |
| UI scaffolding | shadcn/ui CLI | 4.21.5 | Adds and maintains locally owned UI components using the configured aliases and style. | `package.json`, `components.json` |
| Component workbench | Ladle | 5.1.1 | Develops and reviews components in isolation through colocated `*.stories.tsx` files. | `.ladle/`, `package.json` |
| Unit and component testing | Vitest + React Testing Library | Vitest 5.0.5 | Runs colocated unit, hook, and component tests in `jsdom` (`unit` project). | `vitest.config.mts`, `package.json` |
| Property-based testing | fast-check | 4.10.2 | Generates inputs for pure logic such as `isLocale`. | `package.json`, `src/i18n/routing.test.ts` |
| Browser component testing | Vitest Browser Mode + `vitest-browser-react` | Chromium through Playwright | Runs `*.browser.test.tsx` files in a real browser (`browser` project). | `vitest.config.mts`, `package.json` |
| End-to-end testing | Playwright | `^1.64.1` | Runs `tests/*.spec.ts` against a production build. | `playwright.config.ts`, `tests/` |
| Accessibility testing | `@axe-core/playwright` | 4.14.0 | Scans pages for WCAG 2.x A/AA violations in Playwright (`@a11y`). | `tests/a11y.spec.ts` |
| Visual regression | Playwright screenshots | Linux baselines generated and compared in CI | Compares full-page screenshots against baselines (`@visual`). | `tests/visual.spec.ts`, `tests/visual.spec.ts-snapshots/` |
| Mutation testing | Stryker with the `command` runner | 10.0.0 (see [Known limitations](#known-limitations)) | On-demand mutation analysis of selected logic; runs the unit tests once per mutant. | `stryker.config.json`, `vitest.mutation.config.mts` |
| Unused code | Knip | 6.41.0 | Finds unused files, exports, and dependencies. | `knip.jsonc` |
| Architecture boundaries | dependency-cruiser | 18.6.0 | Enforces layering rules and forbids dependency cycles. | `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` |
| Structural rules | ast-grep | 0.51.0 | Enforces project conventions that need syntax awareness (currently a warning-level hint about manual memoization, per `CODING_STANDARDS.md`). Rules have snapshot tests. | `sgconfig.yml`, `.ast-grep/` |
| Duplication | jscpd | 5.4.1 | Reports meaningful duplicated code. | `.jscpd.json` |
| Complexity and health | Fallow | 3.33.1 | Reports complexity, CRAP score (from real coverage), and hotspots. `.ladle/` is excluded on purpose: it is tooling glue that Ladle loads by convention. Vendored `src/components/ui/*.tsx` and `ai-elements` are excluded; custom code under `ui/extensions/` is analyzed. Dead-code, duplication, and architecture analysis stay with Knip, jscpd, and dependency-cruiser. | `.fallowrc.json` |
| React diagnostics | React Doctor | 0.9.18 | Scans application React code for correctness, performance, and security issues. | `doctor.config.json` |
| Bundle budgets | Size Limit + `@size-limit/file` | 14.2.0 | Fails when generated client JavaScript or CSS exceeds its gzip budget. | `.size-limit.json` |
| Performance audit | Lighthouse | 13.5.0 | On-demand performance and accessibility report. | `package.json` |
| Spelling | CSpell | 10.4.0 | Checks spelling in code, JSON, and Markdown. | `cspell.json` |
| Markdown | markdownlint-cli2 | 0.23.3 | Lints repository Markdown. | `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` |
| Static security | Semgrep Community Edition | Host tool (CI pins 1.178.0) | Runs the project's security rules on `src` with `--error` so findings fail the run; `check:security:rules` tests them against an annotated fixture. | `tests/semgrep/rules.yml`, `tests/semgrep/rules.tsx`, `package.json` |
| Secret scanning | Gitleaks | Host tool (CI pins 8.30.1) | Scans the Git history for secrets with `gitleaks git --redact`. `detect` is deprecated upstream. | `package.json` (`check:secrets`) |
| Dependency audit | `pnpm audit` | Included with pnpm | Reports known vulnerable dependencies. | `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`auditConfig`) |
| Continuous integration | GitHub Actions | Pinned by commit SHA | Runs `static`, `build`, `e2e`, `security`, and `pr-title` jobs in parallel on pull requests, pushes to `main`, and manual dispatch, plus a `ci-result` aggregate (see TESTING.md). | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| Workflow linting | actionlint, zizmor | Host tools | Lint and audit the GitHub Actions workflows. | `package.json` (`check:workflows`) |
| Codebase graph | Graphify | Host tool | Builds an on-demand knowledge graph; output goes to the ignored `graphify-out/`. | None |
| Git hooks | Husky + lint-staged + Commitlint | 9.1.7 / 16.4.0 / 21.2.3 | Check staged files with Biome and validate commit messages. | `.husky/`, `package.json`, `commitlint.config.mjs` |
| Repository integrity | pre-commit | Host tool | Runs file-integrity hooks (large files, case conflicts, JSON/YAML, merge markers). | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` |
| Agent configuration | Agents CLI | Repository configuration; CLI is externally provided | Synchronizes reusable agent skills and MCP settings (Serena, Next.js DevTools). | `.agents/agents.json`, `.agents/skills/` |

## Host prerequisites

The repository's own dependencies install with `pnpm install`. These tools live
outside pnpm and are only needed for the commands noted next to them:

| Tool | Needed for | Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js `^22.19.0 \|\| ^24.5.0` | Everything (`engines` in `package.json`) | `node --version` |
| Git | Biome VCS integration, hooks, Fallow hotspots | `git --version` |
| Playwright browsers | `test:browser`, `test:e2e`, `test:a11y`, `test:visual` | `pnpm exec playwright install chromium` |
| pre-commit | Repository-integrity checks in the Git hook | `pre-commit --version` |
| Semgrep | `check:security` | `semgrep --version` |
| Gitleaks | `check:secrets` | `gitleaks version` |
| actionlint, zizmor | `check:workflows` | `actionlint -version`, `zizmor --version` |
| Graphify | On-demand codebase graph | `graphify --version` |

Missing `pre-commit` does not block a commit; the hook prints a warning and skips
only the integrity checks. Biome, Commitlint, and everything else run through
pnpm. In CI or on production installs, set `HUSKY=0` to skip hook installation.

On Windows, `pre-commit` can fail while building its Python virtual environment
with `WinError 206` (path too long) when Python comes from the Microsoft Store.
The Git hook therefore sets `VIRTUALENV_OVERRIDE_APP_DATA` to a short cache
(`~/.virtualenv-cache`) unless you already configured one. Running `pre-commit`
by hand outside the hook may need the same variable.

## Package management

Use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) `12.11.2`, as pinned by the `packageManager`
field in `package.json`. The `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is the lockfile of record.

Do not run `pnpm approve` or install tools that add agent skills; ADR 0007
forbids both. If a package reports "agent skills awaiting approval" (Fallow does),
leave them unapproved.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` / `pnpm build` / `pnpm start` | Develop, build, and serve the Next.js application. |
| `pnpm lint` / `pnpm lint:ci` / `pnpm format` | Biome check, CI check, and formatting. |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Generate route types and run `tsc --noEmit`. |
| `pnpm test` | Fast `unit` Vitest project in `jsdom`. |
| `pnpm test:watch` / `pnpm test:coverage` | Watch mode / coverage (writes `coverage/`). |
| `pnpm test:browser` | `browser` Vitest project in Chromium. |

| `pnpm test:visual:update` | Rewrite baselines. Run it through the **Update visual baselines** workflow, not on your machine. |
| `pnpm test:mutation` | Stryker on selected logic (manual dispatch only in hosted CI until verified; see limitations). |
| `pnpm ladle` / `pnpm ladle:build` | Serve or build the component workbench (`reports/ladle`). |
| `pnpm check:architecture` | dependency-cruiser. |
| `pnpm check:unused` | Knip. |
| `pnpm check:duplicates` | jscpd. |
| `pnpm check:structure` | ast-grep rule tests, then a scan of application code. |
| `pnpm check:spelling` / `pnpm check:markdown` | CSpell / markdownlint. |
| `pnpm check:security` / `pnpm check:security:rules` | Semgrep scan of `src` (fails on findings) / tests of the Semgrep rules. Run inside a Git work tree. |
| `pnpm check:secrets` / `pnpm audit` | Gitleaks / dependency audit. |
| `pnpm check:workflows` | actionlint and zizmor on `.github/workflows`. |
| `pnpm analyze:health` | Unit tests with coverage, then Fallow complexity and CRAP. |
| `pnpm analyze:react` | React Doctor. |
| `pnpm analyze:size` | Production build, then Size Limit budgets. |
| `pnpm analyze:bundle` | Next.js bundle analyzer. |
| `pnpm analyze:lighthouse` | Lighthouse report against a running server. |
| `pnpm analyze:lighthouse:ci` | Same, headless with `--no-sandbox` and an `.html` report path; used by the scheduled workflow. |

### Verification entry points

| Command | Responsibility | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pnpm verify:fast` | Biome CI, typecheck, and the unit tests only. Meant to run constantly. | seconds |
| `pnpm verify:static` | Biome CI, typecheck, unit tests with coverage thresholds, architecture, unused code, duplication, structural rules, spelling, Markdown, Fallow health, and React Doctor. The CI `static` job. | minutes |
| `pnpm verify:build` | Browser tests, production build with size budgets, and the Ladle build. The CI `build` job. | minutes |
| `pnpm verify:full` | `verify:static` then `verify:build`. | minutes |
| `pnpm verify:e2e` | The whole Playwright suite: functional, accessibility, and visual. | minutes |
| `pnpm verify:security` | Semgrep rule tests and scan, Gitleaks, workflow linting, and the dependency audit. Needs the host tools; the same checks run in the CI `security` job. | seconds |

`verify:full` intentionally excludes Playwright, security scanners, mutation
testing, and Lighthouse because they are slow or need host tools. Run
`verify:e2e` and `verify:security` before opening a pull request that touches
what they cover.

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for the test strategy and workflows.

## Application libraries

The application additionally uses React 19, `next-intl`, `next-themes`, Lucide
icons, and the locally owned shadcn/ui component source. These are application
libraries rather than developer tools; see `package.json` for their complete,
current list. Internationalization starts at `src/i18n/request.ts`, and the
theming decision is recorded in ADR 0003.

## Configuration sources

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `package.json` | Dependencies, scripts, and `lint-staged`. |
| `pnpm-workspace.yaml` | Native-build allowlist, security `overrides`, and `auditConfig`. |
| `next.config.ts` | Next.js, Turbopack, React Compiler, and `next-intl` configuration. |
| `tsconfig.json` | TypeScript compiler settings and the `@/*` alias. |
| `biome.json` | Biome formatting, linting, and custom-rule configuration. |
| `.biome/rules/nextjs/*.grit` | GritQL source for project-specific Biome rules. |
| `components.json` | shadcn/ui configuration and import aliases. |
| `vitest.config.mts` | `unit` and `browser` projects and coverage. |
| `vitest.mutation.config.mts` | Unit-only Vitest config used by Stryker. |
| `playwright.config.ts` | Playwright projects, web server, and screenshot tolerance. |
| `.ladle/config.mjs`, `.ladle/vite.config.mjs`, `.ladle/components.tsx` | Ladle stories glob, Vite (Tailwind, `@` alias), and global providers and CSS. |
| `.size-limit.json` | Size budgets for `.next/static/chunks`. |
| `sgconfig.yml`, `.ast-grep/` | ast-grep rules and their snapshot tests. |
| `knip.jsonc`, `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`, `.jscpd.json`, `.fallowrc.json`, `doctor.config.json` | Analysis tool configuration. |
| `cspell.json`, `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` | Documentation quality. |
| `tests/semgrep/` | Semgrep rules and their annotated test fixture. |
| `.github/dependabot.yml` | Weekly grouped npm, GitHub Actions, and mirror-file updates. |
| `.github/dependabot-mirror/` | Dockerfile and `requirements.txt` that let Dependabot bump the Playwright image and the pip-installed CI tools. |
| `.github/workflows/scheduled-quality.yml` | Weekly Lighthouse; Stryker by manual dispatch only until hosted CI is verified. |
| `.husky/`, `commitlint.config.mjs`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | Git hooks and commit validation. |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Continuous integration. |
| `.github/workflows/visual-baselines.yml` | Manual workflow that regenerates the visual baselines in CI. |
| `.gitattributes` | Enforces LF line endings so Biome and hooks behave the same on Windows. |
| `.agents/agents.json` | Agent and MCP configuration. |

Generated output (`reports/`, `coverage/`, `.next/`, `test-results/`,
`playwright-report/`, `.stryker-tmp/`, `graphify-out/`) is ignored. Ladle
configuration in `.ladle/` is versioned; only its build output is ignored.

## Custom rule registry

Native rules are preferred; every custom rule below exists because no native
rule, type constraint, or specialized tool covers it. Add a row here, with
valid and invalid tests, before registering a new custom rule.

| Rule | Owner | Severity | Scope | Why it is not native |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `prefer-page-props` | Grit (Biome plugin) | error | `export default async function Page({ params }: {...})` | Next.js accepts compatible hand-written types, so TypeScript will not reject them. This enforces the generated `PageProps<"/route">` helper ([Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page)). Convention, not a framework requirement. |
| `prefer-layout-props` | Grit (Biome plugin) | error | `export default function Layout({ children }: { children: ReactNode })` | Same reasoning for `LayoutProps<"/route">`. `Readonly<{ children: ReactNode }>` is not matched. |
| `prefer-route-context` | Grit (Biome plugin) | error | Route Handlers `GET`/`POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` with a hand-written `{ params }` | Same reasoning for `RouteContext<"/route">`. |
| `no-manual-memoization-ts` / `-tsx` | ast-grep | warning | `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `memo` in `src/app`, `src/hooks`, `src/i18n`, `src/lib` | No native Biome rule. React Compiler makes most of these redundant but [React still documents them as escape hatches](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/introduction), so this is a hint, not an error. Keep the call and comment the reason when it is intentional. |
| `no-dynamic-tailwind-class` | ast-grep | error | `className` values and `cn`/`clsx`/`cva` calls in app code (vendored files excluded) | Template literals such as `bg-${color}-500` are never generated because [Tailwind scans for complete class names](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/detecting-classes-in-source-files). Functional, not stylistic; no native Biome rule. |
| `no-hardcoded-ui-attribute` | ast-grep | warning | `aria-label`, `aria-description`, `title`, `placeholder`, `alt` with a literal containing letters | `noJsxLiterals` runs with `ignoreProps`, so attributes are unchecked. A warning because brand names and similar values need judgment; `alt=""` is allowed. |
| `no-server-api-in-client-components` | Semgrep | error | `"use client"` files importing `next/headers` | Complements `no-server-only-in-client-components`; fails with a clear message before the framework build error. |
| `session-cookie-must-be-http-only` | Semgrep | error | a `.set()` call whose cookie name contains session, token, auth or sid, without `httpOnly: true` and `secure: true` | [Next.js authentication guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/authentication). Matches by cookie name only, so unrelated cookies (theme, locale) are never flagged. |
| `no-ignored-build-errors` | Semgrep | error | `ignoreBuildErrors: true` in `src` and `next.config.ts` | Dangerous build configuration; no native rule. |
| Other Semgrep rules in `tests/semgrep/rules.yml` | Semgrep | error | `src` | Env access in client components, `eval`, HTML sinks, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, and secrets in `NEXT_PUBLIC_` names. `API_KEY` is deliberately not treated as a secret (public Firebase web keys). Each rule has valid and invalid cases in `tests/semgrep/rules.tsx`. |

### Reference repositories surveyed

The 156 distinct rule and config files across `notes-app` (`dev`,
`firebase/file`, `old-11`) and `exams-app` (`main`,
`chore/development-quality-tooling`) were reviewed by name and grouped. Only
the rules above were adopted. The rest fall into these groups, none of which
is reintroduced:

- **Next.js 16 removed or deprecated APIs** (`next16-*`, `app-router-legacy-*`,
  `async-*-access`): `next build` and generated types already reject them.
- **Props, variants, Base UI and Accordion/ToggleGroup APIs** (`base-ui-*`,
  `shadcn-*-props`, `component-props-type`): TypeScript.
- **shadcn composition and anatomy** (`shadcn-*`, `*-composition`,
  `*-title`): optional recommendations that a same-file pattern cannot judge
  (extracted composition is valid). They stay in the shadcn skill; behavior is
  covered by axe and Playwright.
- **Hooks placement and inline components** (`exported-hook-location`,
  `extract-stateful-hooks`, `no-inline-hook-definition`): Biome
  `noNestedComponentDefinitions` and `useHookAtTopLevel`; hooks may be colocated.
- **Effects and state** (`react-effect-set-state`, controlled/uncontrolled
  rules): React Doctor and TypeScript.
- **Tailwind style preferences** (`logical-properties`, `no-inline-styles`,
  semantic-color and spacing rules): optional preferences; Biome gets native
  rules when upgraded.
- **i18n** (`next-intl-*`): JSX text is covered by `noJsxLiterals`, keys by
  typed next-intl, catalogs by `messages.test.ts`. Dynamic keys and toast
  literals are deferred until the template has toasts.
- **Security** (`next-*` server rules): see "Security checks not adopted".

### Native Biome rules evaluated for this version (2.4.2)

- **Enabled:** `noJsxLiterals` (`ignoreProps`), `noReactForwardRef` (React 19
  passes `ref` as a prop; relaxed for vendored components), and the `next` and
  `react` domains, which include `noNestedComponentDefinitions`,
  `useHookAtTopLevel`, and `useExhaustiveDependencies`.
- **Not available in 2.4.2:** `noInlineStyles`, `noTailwindRawColors`,
  `noTailwindArbitraryValue`, `useTailwindShorthandClasses`. Revisit after a
  Biome upgrade; do not reintroduce them as Grit rules.
- **Not adopted:** `noNamespaceImport` (only flags `import * as React`, which the
  shadcn convention uses, and vendored Radix/Base UI wrappers);
  `noDeprecatedImports` (needs the project scanner, about 5x slower on every
  lint-staged run, and only flagged vendored files); `noFloatingPromises` (still
  in `nursery`); `noRestrictedImports` for `next/link` (ADR 0004 prefers the
  localized `@/i18n/navigation` helpers, but `src/app/page.tsx` uses external
  links; adopt it once locale-prefixed internal links exist).
- **Security checks not adopted:** unsafe Server Action input handling, missing
  authorization near sensitive operations, and private data in shared caches.
  The template has no auth, database, or Server Actions to validate rules
  against, `.parse()` or `throw` does not prove safety, and Next.js already
  rejects `cookies()` or `headers()` inside `"use cache"`. Gitleaks owns
  real secrets. Add taint-mode rules once a data access layer exists.
- **Left to TypeScript:** component props, variants, Base UI and Accordion /
  ToggleGroup APIs, and async `params`. No Grit rule duplicates them.

## Known limitations

- **Vendored components are excluded from coverage, Fallow health, React Doctor,
  and relaxed in Biome.** Formatting and import organization are disabled for the
  distributed shadcn/ui and AI Elements files; the existing targeted lint
  exceptions still apply. The exclusions cover the preinstalled shadcn/ui files
  (`src/components/ui/*.tsx`) and `src/components/ai-elements/`. Project code
  that lives beside them, such as `src/components/ui/extensions/`, is fully
  checked. The upstream `src/app/typeset.css` is not auto-formatted, and
  standalone `public/*.svg` assets are excluded from Biome; accessible names
  must still be supplied at their points of use. Fallow reports `38/1304 functions matched` for coverage because the
  denominator includes those vendored functions; every covered file is matched.
- **CI hotspot analysis needs history.** The `static` job checks out with
  `fetch-depth: 0` so Fallow can compute hotspots; other jobs use shallow clones
  except `security`, which Gitleaks needs in full.

- **Stryker uses the `command` runner.** The native `@stryker-mutator/vitest-runner`
  10.0.0 does not work with Vitest 5.0.5: mutants inside functions are never
  activated and always survive (a ~5% score), and neither a non-hidden temp
  directory nor `inPlace` changes that. The `command` runner activates mutants
  through `__STRYKER_ACTIVE_MUTANT__` and works, at the cost of running the unit
  tests once per mutant (about 10 minutes for the four targets). Switch back to
  the `vitest` runner when it supports Vitest 5.
- **Dependency audit exception.** `braces` (GHSA-vfj7-8cjw-p6xm) has no patched
  release and none is expected: the maintainer closed
  [micromatch/braces#84](https://github.com/micromatch/braces/issues/84) as
  not-to-fix and disputes the advisory. Every current release of `fast-glob`,
  `globby`, `markdownlint-cli2`, and `shadcn` still depends on it, so no upgrade
  removes it. It is ignored in `auditConfig`. It is reached only through
  developer tools (shadcn CLI, Ladle, markdownlint) that expand fixed, trusted
  glob patterns. Remove the exception if the advisory is withdrawn or the chain
  drops `braces`; a local `pnpm patch` is not worth maintaining for this
  exposure.
- **Visual tests run only in CI.** Baselines are Linux screenshots, generated and
  compared inside the pinned Playwright container (the `container` image in
  `ci.yml` and `visual-baselines.yml`), so rendering is identical every time.
  Locally the visual specs are skipped. Keep the image tag and digest in step with
  the `@playwright/test` version in `package.json` when you upgrade Playwright.

## Agent tooling

Reusable agent skills and MCP configuration live in `.agents/`. Run
`agents sync` after changing `.agents/agents.json` or reusable skills, and use
`agents sync --check` before opening a pull request that changes them.

Use Context7 when current library documentation is needed. The project-local
`context7-cli` skill documents its two-step library lookup and documentation
query flow.
